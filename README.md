Linux Workstation Setup
===
A semi-working Ansible playbook for configuring my Linux GNOME workstation.

This is the first semi-working version and will be improved soon.
Planned improvements:
- Split configuration into variables, tasks, and roles
- Add dotfiles installation
- Improve idempotency
- Add more customization options

At this point, I haven't found a way to install extensions idempotently and it has to be done manually.
